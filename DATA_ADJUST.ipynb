    "The columns I added to individual player data are the percent of the team shots each player made (for 2s, 3s, and free throws), an approximate points prevented variable (calculated by multiplying number of blocks and number of steals by 2, then subtracting 2 for each turnover), and a margin variable indicating how many more (less if negative) points the team had at the end of the game.  The reason for the first three is so that I can look at approximately how many shots each individual player contributed per game of all kinds, so to better understand their offensive contribution to the game as a whole.  In like manner, points prevented is to better understand the defensive contribution each player made.  The margin variable makes it easier to compare the overall result of the game (win or lose by x points) together with each player's individual contributions.\n",

    "I had to redo a bit of my data cleaning because I realized that I dropped games where a player didn't play at all, which threw off my numbers a bit.  To remedy this, I went back and switch all games that were \"Did not play\" with a stat of either $0$ or $0-0$.  While I'm currently not sure how exactly I want to handle games that they didn't participate in, I feel this is the best way to currently store the information.  It's simple enough to fix if later on I decide that it needs to be a different value."
